#  NFT Warranty System

* The Warranty System of today comes with many flaws of its own. Simple Digital warranties are highly prone to tampering by wrongdoers which results in heavy losses to the retailers in the market today.❌

* How can we fix this??

* Bit offensive store tackles this problem by Decentralizing the entire system of **warranty ownership and claim**.✅

* We provide **ERC-721 Non-fungible tokens** as warranties to the customers which are immutable and easily verifiable.

* The NFT tokens provided by us are **Decaying in nature** which after a certain period, cannot be claimed for warranty benefits offered by the brand/retailer.🏁
